### Welcome to the home of Ksnarf code (KSN, or ksnarf.dev) 

You will find a bunch of different repos based on a bunch of different projects, primarily I focus on Powershell for my work and lua for my personal projects but as always I am branching out

If you have questions about why something is the way it is, feel free to ask.
